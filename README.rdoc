= Paranoid Vestal Versions for Rails 2.3

Forked from:

<tt>berga/vestal_versions</tt>[http://github.com/berga/vestal_versions] by berga[http://github.com/berga] who patched VestalVersions::Version to use a "modifications" column instead of "change" due to a conflict in ActiveRecord 2.3
<tt>laserlemon/vestal_versions</tt>[http://github.com/laserlemon/vestal_versions] by laserlemon[http://github.comlaserlemon] who created the mainstream version of vestal_versions

== So what's different?

Dependency on "acts_as_paranoid"[http://github.com/technoweenie/acts_as_paranoid] by technoweenie[http://github.com/technoweenie] so Versions are not destroyed.
